#Predicting Stock Prices with Machine Learning

This script predicts stock prices utilizing machine learning. Quandl API is used (Note: Quandl WIKI API no longer is actively supported as of 04-11-2018, meaning this script CANNOT predict stock prices as of 2020.) This script is written following a [Tinker Tuesday tutorial](https://thecodex.me/projects/predicting-stock-prices-with-machine-learning/0/lecture/446959674) from TheCodex.


## Motivation 
In my course of studying computer science, I have been interested in the intersectionality of computer science and other academic and professional fields. Notably, I have not taken any  machinese learning classes at Drexel University as of the fall of 2020; but figured this would be a fun, informative script to follow.

## Technologies
This project was created with:
* Python 3.6
* Jupyter Notebook
* Quandl API
* pandas: v.1.1.
* sklearn
